                In World of Tanks you play in teams of 15 against each other and your job is to destroy all other enemy
                tanks.
                You can also win by capturing the enemy base, or capturing hills and collecting points until you win.
                This depends on which map and gamemode you play.<br><br>
                World of Tanks features more than 200 tanks from different country's:
                U.S.A, Germany, U.S.S.R, France, Japan, China, Czechoslovakia and Sweden.
                To be albe to play all those tanks you have to start at tier I. For each battle you play
                you earn experience, and the better you perform in the battle, the more Xp you earn.
                To unlock more tanks you need enough Xp to go to the next tier. The highest tier you can play
                is tier X.<br><br> World of tanks also has over 30 different maps with lots of different strategy's.
                Overall it is a really fun, but also a really hard game.
                And you definitely need to spend a lot of time to get better, and learn new things about the game.
